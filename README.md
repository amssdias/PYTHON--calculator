# PYTHON Calculator Algorithm

I have built a Calculator without using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operators (`+`, `-`, `*` and `/`) directly. 
It was only based on the `Addition.add()` function from the `addition` module.

This Class have 4 methods, each for each operation:
* `Calculator.add()`
* `Calculator.subtract()`
* `Calculator.multiply()`
* `Calculator.divide()`
